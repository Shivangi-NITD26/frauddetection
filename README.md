CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION ML PROJECT Full dataset can be downloaded from:[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions specifically for the United States financial market, using a real-world dataset of US-based transactions.  

# -Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression<br>
Decision Tree  

# -Analysis:
Logistic Regression achieved the highest recall (77%) and the best ROC-AUC score (0.84), indicating strong ability to detect fraud cases. However, it suffers from extremely low precision (1%), meaning a high number of false positives.  

Decision Tree provided a better balance between precision and recall, resulting in the highest F1-score (0.19) for the fraud class. It also showed a very high overall accuracy (98%) and a strong ROC-AUC score (0.83).
